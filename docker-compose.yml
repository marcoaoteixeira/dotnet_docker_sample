# To use HTTPS, you'll need a certificate. Also, define Kestrel env variables:
# ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Path: The path to the certificate.
# ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password: The certificate password.
# As a recommendation, these variables should be defined by your CI/CD system.
